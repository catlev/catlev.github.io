    <h1>Constraints</h1>
    
    <p>
        Constraints are facts about a model that the runtime system ensures are
        always true by preventing data that violates those constraints from
        being committed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Constraints are useful for two important reasons. They ensure that the
        data upon which you are operating is well-formed for its target domain.
        They also document how the data application is intended to operate, so
        enabling teams of people to work on the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Uniqueness Constraint</h2>

    <p>
        The most basic constraint is the uniqueness constraint. This asserts 
        that, for a particular entity type and set of attributes, there are no
        two entities with the same field values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Uniqueness is implied by identifying attributes and relationships, but
        may be asserted separately as well.
    </p>

    <er-example title="single identifying attribute">
        entity_type {
            name: "A"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }
        }
    </er-example>

    <er-example title="multiple identifying attributes">
        entity_type {
            name: "citizen"

            attribute { name: "name" type: "string" identifying: "true" }
            attribute { name: "dob" type: "date" identifying: "true" }
            attribute { name: "address" type: "string" }
        }
    </er-example>

    <er-example title="auxilliary uniqueness">
        entity_type {
            name: "tree_node"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }
            attribute { name: "parent_id" type: "integer"}
            attribute { name: "name" type: "string"}

            unique {
                attribute { name: "parent_id" }
                attribute { name: "name" }
            }
        }
    </er-example>

    <h2>Existence Constraint</h2>

    <p>
        This asserts that, for a particular entity type <er-eqn>A</er-eqn> and 
        entity type <er-eqn>B</er-eqn> and relationship <er-eqn>f</er-eqn>, for
        every entity in <er-eqn>A</er-eqn> there exists a <er-eqn>B</er-eqn>
        that is accessible by following <er-eqn>f</er-eqn>. This can be written
        <er-eqn>f: A -> B</er-eqn>. In this case <er-eqn>A</er-eqn> is the
        source entity and <er-eqn>B</er-eqn> is the target entity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Existence is implied by describing a relationship of cardinality one 
        (the default).
    </p>

    <er-example title="defining a relationship">
        entity_type {
            name: "A"

            relationship { name: "f" type: "B" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "B"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }
        }
    </er-example>

    <p>
        The logical-to-physical transformation elaborates these kinds of
        relationships so that the attributes necessary to implement them exist.
    </p>

    <h2>Commutativity Constraint</h2>

    <p>
        This asserts that, for entity types <er-eqn>A</er-eqn> and
        <er-eqn>B</er-eqn> and relationships <er-eqn>f: A -> B</er-eqn> and
        <er-eqn>g: A -> B</er-eqn>, for every entity in <er-eqn>A</er-eqn>,
        following <er-eqn>f</er-eqn> leads to the same <er-eqn>B</er-eqn> as
        following <er-eqn>g</er-eqn>. In this case <er-eqn>A</er-eqn> is the
        source entity type and <er-eqn>B</er-eqn> is the scope entity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Typically, commutativity extends over more than two entity types. The
        classic case is of four entity types that form a square.
    </p>

    <p>
        Commutativity is described by scopes on relationships. A scope is 
        written as an equation of two paths. The lhs is called the <i>riser</i>
        and the rhs is called the <i>diagonal</i>. The diagonal starts at the
        source entity and ends at the scope entity. The riser starts at the
        target entity and ends at the scope entity.
    </p>

    <er-example title="comuting square">
        entity_type {
            name: "A"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "f_2" type: "B" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "B"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

        }

        entity_type {
            name: "C"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "f_1" type: "A" }
            relationship { name: "g_1" type: "D" scope: "g_2=f_1/f_2" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "D"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "g_2" type: "B" identifying: "true" }
        }
    </er-example>

    <p>
        More than two relationships may be said to commute. This follows
        straightforwardly from the definition given above.
    </p>

    <er-example title="commuting cube">
        entity_type {
            name: "A"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "f_2" type: "B" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "B"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

        }

        entity_type {
            name: "C"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "f_1" type: "A" }
            relationship { name: "g_1" type: "D" scope: "g_2=f_1/f_2&i=h_1/h_2" }
            relationship { name: "h_1" type: "E" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "D"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "g_2" type: "B" identifying: "true" }
            relationship { name: "i" type: "F" identifying: "true" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "E"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }

            relationship { name: "h_2" type: "E" }
        }

        entity_type {
            name: "F"

            attribute { name: "id" type: "integer" identifying: "true" }
        }
    </er-example>

    <h2>Pullback Constraint</h2>

    <p>
        This asserts that, for a commuting square of entities
        <er-eqn>A</er-eqn>, <er-eqn>B</er-eqn>, <er-eqn>C</er-eqn> and
        <er-eqn>D</er-eqn> and relationships <er-eqn>f_1: C -> A</er-eqn>,
        <er-eqn>f_2: A -> B</er-eqn>, <er-eqn>g_1: C -> D</er-eqn> and
        <er-eqn>g_2: D -> B</er-eqn>, for every pair of (<er-eqn>A</er-eqn>,
        <er-eqn>D</er-eqn>) where (<er-eqn>f_2</er-eqn>, <er-eqn>g_2</er-eqn>)
        respectively refer to the same <er-eqn>B</er-eqn>, there exists a
        <er-eqn>C</er-eqn>.
